Stopwatch Web Application
Hello Everyone,

I’m thrilled to present my Stopwatch web application, developed as part of my journey with Prodigy Infotech. This project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a fully functional stopwatch with start, pause, reset, and lap time tracking capabilities.

This application provided a fantastic opportunity to dive deeper into JavaScript, honing my skills in creating interactive and responsive web applications. I’m eager to continue learning and taking on more projects!
